# MenuNook Landing Page

This repository contains the public landing page for MenuNook, a simple tool for pop-up sellers, market vendors, and small-batch makers who want an easy way to share what they’re offering. MenuNook lets anyone create a lightweight, mobile-friendly menu that customers can open instantly through a link or QR code.

## Philosophy

Communicating value can be simple, clean, and effective. I went with a very minimalistic approach here that focused more on clear value communication. No jargon. Nothing fancy.

Just a page that communicates the win.
